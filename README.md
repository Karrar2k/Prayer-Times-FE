# How to Use the App


  Open in Your Browser:
        Launch the app in your browser of choice. (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
        For the best experience, make sure the app is accessible and visible.

  Enable a Reminder:
        Use the “Enable Reminders” toggle on the main interface.
        Specify how many minutes before the prayer you want to be reminded.

  Select a Sound and Volume:
        Open the Settings Modal (gear icon at the top-right).
        Choose your preferred reminder sound and adjust the volume.

  Pin the Tab:
        Once reminders are enabled, pin the browser tab by right-clicking it and selecting “Pin Tab.”
        This ensures the app is always active and doesn’t accidentally get closed.

  Receive Timely Notifications:
        The app will play your selected sound before each prayer at the configured time.
        For example, if you set a 10-minute reminder, you will hear the sound 10 minutes before the prayer.

  Adhan Playback:
        If you wish to hear the full Adhan at the exact prayer time, enable the "Prayer Call" toggle in the settings.
